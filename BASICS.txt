Stack is a linear data structure which follows LIFO pattern in which the operations are performed.

------------------------------------
Basic operations in Stack.
>Push
	Adds an item in the Stack. 
	If the Stack is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.

>Pop
	Removes an item from the top of the Stack.
	If the Stack is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
 
>Peek
	Returns top element of Stack.

>isEmpty
	Returns true if Stack is empty, else false.

------------------------------------
The push(), pop(), isEmpty() and peek() all take O(1) time.

There are two ways to implement a stack:
--Using array		(easy to implement.. but it's size is static)
--Using linked list
