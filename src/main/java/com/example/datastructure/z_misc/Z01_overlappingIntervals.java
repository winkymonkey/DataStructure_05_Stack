 * Merge Overlapping Intervals
 * ********************************************************************************
 * Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one 
 * and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals.
 * Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity. 
 * 
 * let the given set of intervals be {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8}}.
 * The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1,4}
 * Similarly, {5,7} and {6,8} should be merged and become {5,8}

	 * ---MORE EFFICIENT APPROACH---
	 * -----------------------------
	 * In above problem, the sorting takes time of O(nLog(n)) & merging happens in O(n) time
	 * But the merge process takes O(n) extra space.
	 * 
	 * We can reduce the space, if we can do in-place merging
