 * The Stock Span Problem
 * *****************************************************************************
 * It is a financial problem where we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock. 
 * We need to calculate span of stock’s price for all n days.
 * 
 * The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i is defined as:
 * the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the stock price on the current day is <= its price on the given day.
 * 
 * *****************************************************************************
 * If an array of 7 days prices is given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}
 * then the span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6}
 * 
 * For day-1: 	stock price is 100		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 1 (day1:100)
 * For day-2: 	stock price is 80		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 1 (day2:80)
 * For day-3: 	stock price is 60		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 1 (day3:60)
 * For day-4: 	stock price is 70		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 2 (day3:60, day4:70)
 * For day-5: 	stock price is 60		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 1 (day5:60)
 * For day-6: 	stock price is 75		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 4 (day3:60, day4:70, day5:60, day6:75)
 * For day-7: 	stock price is 85		number of days prior to it where price was lesser or equal is 1 (day2"80, day3:60, day4:70, day5:60, day6:75)
 *
