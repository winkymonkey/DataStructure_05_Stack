 * *****************************************************************************
 * Implement two stacks in an array
 * *****************************************************************************
 * Create a data structure twoStacks that represents two stacks.
 * Implementation of twoStacks should use only one array
 * (i.e. both stacks should use the same array for storing elements)
 * 
 * Following functions must be supported by twoStacks.
 *  - push1(int x) –> pushes x to first stack
 *  - push2(int x) –> pushes x to second stack
 *  - pop1() –> pops an element from first stack and return the popped element
 *  - pop2() –> pops an element from second stack and return the popped element
 * 
 * Implementation of twoStack should be space efficient.

	 * Both stacks grow (or shrink) in opposite direction.

	 * To check for overflow, all we need to check is for space between top elements of both stacks.
